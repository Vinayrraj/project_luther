# Project Luther
###### Week 2 & Week 3

## Backstory:

Using information we scrape from the web, can we build linear regression models from which we can learn about either the movie, sports or something else of your choice.

### Data:

 * **acquisition**: web scraping
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: (as listed below or any other publicly available information)   
  - movie: boxofficemojo.com, imdb.com   
  - sports: sports-reference.com
  - https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
  - https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch
  - https://data.seattle.gov/
  - https://www.data.gov/
  

### Skills:

 * basics of the web (requests, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
 * web scraping
 * `numpy` and `pandas`
 * `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`


### Analysis:

 * linear regression is required, other regression methods are optional


## [Deliverable/communication](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LZIopEqoMBo-YdfYtvIUjDVScNcjshuAn-1CC4HfEJc/edit?usp=sharing):

 * Proposal - toward the beginning (explaining the goals of the project, data set to be used, etc.)
 * Organized project repository
 * 4 mins presentation/student
 * Visual and oral communication in presentations
 * Summary - after the presentation (explaining the outcomes of the project)
 * We suggest to have at least 1000 data points and 10 features.  We recommend to minimize the number of categorical features and maximize the number of numerical features.

### Design:

 * iterative design process
 * "MVP"s and building outward


## More information:

We'll learn about web scraping using two popular tools - BeautifulSoup and Selenium. You'll have to know the very basics of HTML. We'll also be evolving the way we use IPython notebooksâ€”during this project we'll begin to use the notebook as a development scratchpad, where we test things out through interactive scripting, but then solidify our work in python modules with reusable functions and classes.

We'll practice using linear regression. We'll have a first taste of feature selection, this time based on our intuition and some trial and error, and we'll build and refine our models.


This project will give you the freedom to challenge yourself, no matter your skill level. Find your boundaries and push them a little further. We are very excited to see what you will learn and do for Project Luther!
